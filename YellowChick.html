                <strong>History/Info:</strong> Yellow Chick shares her existence with the Pastel Bunny and was originally discovered in a cornfield. It is believed that her origin is tied to a meteor impact in the vicinity a week before her discovery. Throughout her time at the Compound, Yellow Chick has displayed remarkable cooperation and well-behaved tendencies. Despite rarely making requests, her fondness for candy emerged when she was found gorging on chocolates in the break room. She has consistently displayed contentment with her presence at the Compound, showing no inclination to leave and a preference for remaining on-site.
