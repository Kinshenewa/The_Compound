            <p><strong>Low Security:</strong> Rooms in this category have 2-4 Helpers assigned for added security and support.</p>
            <p><strong>Medium Security:</strong> With 5-7 Helpers assigned, medium-security rooms provide an elevated level of assistance and protection.</p>
            <p><strong>High Security:</strong> For inhabitants who require increased protection, high-security rooms are staffed with 8-10 Helpers.</p>
