                <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>This guy seems made out of code or something, and dude is sentient too. He can understand us perfectly and even is able to respond back with understandable words.</li>
                    <li>The Entity is capable of surfing the net and possesses the ability to manipulate technology. If he were to be let loose, it is unknown what sort of chaos he will sow.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Glitchcrawler is inquisitive and mischievous, often playing small pranks on the researchers who communicate with it via an old computer from the 80's, which is where it is contained in a 30 by 30 foot room insulated with 10 feet of concrete. Glitchcrawler has shown a fascination with human behavior, finding humans fascinating and loving to read more material on them. He is capable of reading a large book within seconds, though he has mentioned it is more enjoyable when he takes the time to enjoy it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Appearance:</strong> Glitchcrawler is capable of taking any form and changing their colors at will, though he has shown a marked preference to look like the rabbit from the FNAF Ruin game. With a very similar design to the rabbit, he also has greens and blues mixed in, as if imitating a galaxy. He likes to have pure white eyes and white splattered on his hands and feet, like he dipped his extremities in paint. He has shown a preference for showing himself as mildly muscular and tall, preferring to have wider shoulders than hips.

                <strong>Warnings:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Never ever bring any technology into his room, or else he will jump to that technology and make an escape. It was hard enough capturing him, we had to corner him in Wikipedia when he was editing one of the articles saying Hitler had an affair with Stalin.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>He is able to manipulate code at will.</li>
                    <li>Able to jump between pieces of technology, and zoom off somewhere else if connected to wifi. Anything that needs electricity, he is capable of jumping into.</li>
                    <li>When given access to speakers, he is able to cause visual and auditory hallucinations, creating imperceptible sound waves that cause the researcher to see things that aren't there.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Room:</strong> Maximum Security Level 7 room.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Room Number:</strong> 404
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Permissions:</strong> Once a week, a USB is brought in, only holding a handful of gigabytes, and plugged into an intermediary between the computer and the USB. This ensures the Entity doesn't try to escape through the USB, as the intermediary is disconnected from the computer, and after it has been transferred all of the information from the USB, it shoves that information into the computer, not allowing Glitchcrawler to make a move to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>History/Info:</strong> Word of him spread 7 years before containment, with half a decade of that time used to try and catch him. He had done a good job of evading the Compound, but one day he made a mistake and accessed a Wikipedia page in a small town, where the internet was shut off near instantly and he was trapped. His mischievous nature had been his downfall, as he had been editing a Wikipedia page and saying that Hitler and Stalin had had a relationship behind closed doors. Now, he is housed in the Compound, where the internet is all closed circuit, meaning if he got out of containment, there is a very small chance he would be able to escape. All employees are gifted a special phone case that will protect their phone from being targeted by Glitchcrawler, therefore unable to escape, for employee phones are the only technological pieces to be connected to outside internet.
