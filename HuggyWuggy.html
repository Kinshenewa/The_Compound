            <p>
                <strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> When he starts to get aggravated, tranquilize him, he is too dangerous.<br>
                <strong>Notes:</strong><br>
                1. He may be a level 8 but he is about equal in strength to the Shadow King, whenever they fight the results are uniform, Huggy wins some, Shadow King wins some, and they tie.<br>
                2. The previous Handler employed a shock collar, which eventually drove him past the breaking point and caused him to go into a bloodthirsty rampage. The Handler was the first victim.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personality:</strong> He seems calm and curious most of the time, with his chirps and purrs, but at other times he can be a bloodthirsty monster who will stop at no one. That has only happened once and we assure you, it won't happen again.
            </p>

                <strong>Appearance:</strong> When originally caught, he was 17 feet tall, but over time became shorter, to now a more manageable height of 9 feet. He is covered in blue fur all over, except his hands, which are bright yellow mitts. He has been known to sometimes rip those and be able to better use his fingers, but would somehow manage to get it all back together. The smell that emanates from the rips are ghastly. His lips when closed look like a big red sausage, but when open reveals two sets of sharp teeth. See Abilities for more info. His pupils are black, and take up most of his eye. His tongue is long and bright red, with a sharp tip at the end. He has been seen being able to manipulate it like a third hand. He was originally lanky and thin, but over time, as he got shorter, he also became muscular and buff, his limbs thick with muscles.

                <strong>Warnings:</strong><br>
                1. Exercise caution around his mouth.<br>
                2. If he manages to corner or pin you, be careful of what you do, there is no shock collar to save you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Abilities:</strong><br>
                1. He has retractable teeth, allowing him to chew on things without causing harm.<br>
                2. He has a second mouth, which has been seen to be able to come out like from Alien. Or a Moray Eel.<br>
                3. He has no bones, so he has the ability to manipulate them like an octopus manipulates their arms. He has been seen on multiple occasions using this to his advantage and tying up his Handler, as he has been seen to be quite clingy.<br>
                4. Possession of a second stomach, void of stomach acids, appears to function primarily as a storage compartment.

                <strong>History/info:</strong> He was extracted from the old toy factory in Oakland, California. He was found deep in the factory, seeming to have fallen a great height due to his injuries. He was bleeding from multiple spots, and showed hostility towards Helpers when trying to extract him. The smell of poppies seems to enrage him, so tranquilizers were used to put him out, though it took some strong tranquilizers to put him out due to his resilience. The old factory, Playtime Co, is an abandoned toy factory, and Huggy was the face of one of their most popular dolls.
