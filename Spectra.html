                    <li>She is able to make small explosions with her feathers, the explosions never bigger than a tennis ball but able to cause serious damage, almost seeming to delete anything that is affected by it. Experimentation revealed that when flesh was deleted, the flesh closed as if never there in the first place.</li>
                    <li>She can get quite excited in the morning, and her chirps and chattering can be deafening when combined with her extremely bright feathers. Never take off your ear muffs in range of her.</li>
                    <li>She has no need to eat, instead being able to convert sunlight into energy and only needing water every few days. though she is supplied with a small creek that is safe for her to drink and bathe in.</li>

                <strong>History/Info:</strong> She had been found in Sweden attempting to nest in a lighthouse beacon, having shown great joy in standing in the light and charging up her feathers. She had picked up Swedish by listening to people passing by the lighthouse, and after a month housed in the Compound, she was able to pick up English as well. Intelligence tests later revealed she has an IQ of 114, an above average score, and that was shown in her actions when she was able to figure out how to escape her room using the pinpad, which required a pass-code that researchers had never let her see.
