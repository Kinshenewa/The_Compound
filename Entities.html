    Entities are the enigmatic and diverse creatures that inhabit our secure containment facility. Each Entity is a unique and extraordinary being, which necessitates a tailored approach to their care. In the wake of the Incident, we have transitioned from merely selecting eligible individuals to serve as Handlers to a meticulous process of handpicking them based on their compatibility with specific Entities.

    Rating and Classification:
</p>
<p>
    Entities are rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 signifying the lowest level of danger, and 10 indicating the highest. However, this rating system is not as straightforward as it may seem. Each Entity's rating takes into account a myriad of factors, including their behavior, abilities, and potential for harm.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, consider the case of the Yellow Chick. On the basis of her powers alone, she might be classified as a level 2. However, her behavior is consistently non-threatening and cooperative, which has earned her a level 1 classification. In contrast, her counterpart, the Pastel Bunny, possesses similar powers and would also be rated as a level 2. However, his violent tendencies and the psychological distress he can inflict with his speech elevate his classification to level 3.
</p>
<p>
    The Shadow King, with his unique abilities to manipulate shadows, would be a level 8. However, his rating takes into account not only his potential for danger but also his history of causing suffering to his Handlers. Moreover, The Shadow King's ability to lull others into a false sense of security with his calming, smooth voice and the pain he endures in full light are considered when assessing his level. In bright, well-lit environments, he could be as harmless as a level 1, but the discomfort and distress this causes him deter us from such actions.
</p>
<p>
    Our mission at the facility is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for these Entities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our dedicated Handlers. We understand that each Entity is unique, and it is our responsibility to adapt and accommodate their individual needs and characteristics. Our continuous research and careful handling of Entities aim to enhance our understanding of these extraordinary beings, ensuring a harmonious coexistence within our compound.
