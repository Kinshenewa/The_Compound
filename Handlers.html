    Handlers, as we fondly refer to our dedicated employees, play a vital role in the well-being and care of specific Entities within our facility. Each Entity possesses its own distinctive characteristics and requirements, which demand a carefully selected and expertly trained individual to oversee their care and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    In the early stages of our operation, the selection of Handlers was determined by their eligibility, but lessons learned from unfortunate incidents prompted us to adopt a more meticulous approach. Today, Handlers are not merely assigned; they are meticulously handpicked based on their compatibility with the unique nature of the Entities they are entrusted with.

    The daily responsibilities of a Handler are far from ordinary. In many instances, Handlers are required to cohabit with their respective Entities, establishing an unbreakable bond of care and trust. The close relationship between Handlers and Entities is a fundamental aspect of ensuring their physical and emotional well-being. To provide a respite from their demanding responsibilities, Handlers are granted a vacation day each week, which they can choose to utilize at their discretion or save for future use.

    Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that even with a rigorous selection process, certain matches may not be compatible. The Incident, a stark reminder of the potential volatility of some Entities, underscores the necessity of judiciously pairing Handlers with their charges. Ensuring the safety and harmony within our facility remains our utmost priority.

<p>
    In special circumstances, select Entities are permitted to accompany their Handlers to their homes, with the stipulation that a Helper accompanies them. Typically, this privilege extends to Entities classified within levels 1 to 3. However, there have been exceptional cases where exceptions have been made based on the unique needs of the Entity. It is imperative to note that the Shadow King, a level 10 Entity, is an exception in this regard. He is strictly prohibited from leaving our facility until a feasible means of enhancing his solidity or implementing a suitable containment measure is identified.
