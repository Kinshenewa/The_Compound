                <strong>History/Info:</strong> He was discovered a year after the Yellow Chick's containment. She was relaxed in her room, then sighed before her beak started opening wider and wider. She started to implode on herself as a bright lavender and pink blob of flesh came out of her mouth, and before long she was gone. A moment later, the blob formed into the round shape of the Pastel Bunny, who proceeded to swear a storm about how bland the room was and that there should be more to keep his sister occupied. He demanded toys for his sister and that, in his words, "Someone bring in a fucking hamster wheel or something, this fucking room sucks balls and I won't fuckking stand for my sister to be bored out of her fucking mind!" The Pastel Bunny is quite strong-willed compared to his sister, who would do anything she's told to most of the time.
