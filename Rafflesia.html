                    <li>She has a fragile mental state, so be cautious when around her. She appears to have experienced a difficult life and is very claustrophobic.</li>

                    <li>Cadence seems to calm her down considerably, so Cadence is required to visit Rafflesia at least twice a week for 4 hours. Cadence is now officially hired as a comfort Tiny for the monsters and not a technician.</li>
                    <li>Rafflesia is visually impaired but compensates through the use of echolocation and her inherent powers.</li>

                <strong>Permissions:</strong> Once a week she can go outside and practice her venom aim. Afterwards, we take some samples to analyze its composition, which appears to be a mixture of H₂SO₄ (Sulfuric acid) and HSI (Hydrochloric acid), a highly corrosive substance eroding organic materials.

                <strong>History/Info:</strong> Rafflesia was found deep in the Amazon Rainforest and appeared eager to come with our researchers, seemingly searching for a safe place. Her capture involved a temporary containment cell and a volunteer who shared her enthusiasm. Rafflesia is of uncertain origin, claiming a Rainwing and Nightwing lineage from a fictional series. She possesses unique powers and unexplained silver markings on her neck.
