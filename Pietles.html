                <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pietles serve as the carriers and dwellings for the Pie Folk. The majority of their village structures are constructed atop the Pietles' shells. Intriguingly, Pietles seem not to require sustenance beyond a preference for consuming grass.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personality:</strong> Typically characterized by their serene temperament, Pietles exude an air of calmness. However, there have been instances of Pietles reacting with aggression, discharging a sticky black substance against perceived threats. This substance behaves akin to adhesive acid and can prove severely detrimental upon contact with the bloodstream.

            <p>
                <strong>Appearance:</strong> Pietles feature facial features reminiscent of tortoises, while their shells host the diminutive homes of the Pie Folk. Baby Pietles initially measure the size of tennis balls, exhibiting a dark brown hue before later developing photosynthesizing moss. Their skin showcases a deep brown shade, contrasting with the even darker brown shell that resembles soil.

                <strong>Warnings:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Caution should be exercised when approaching Pietles, particularly if they perceive a threat. Their response may involve agitated foot shuffling and low-frequency rumbling sounds, which may affect the mental state of those targeted, making the Pietles appear larger than their actual size.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Their low-frequency rumbling, supplemented by a form of psychic energy, is employed to create an illusion of increased size.</li>

                <strong>History/Info:</strong> The initial discovery of Pietles occurred on a secluded Galapagos island. Interaction between researchers and the Pie Folk initially carried an air of hostility, with the diminutive inhabitants brandishing miniature spears and hurling them like javelins. Following a period of negotiation, the Pie Folk consented to accompany the researchers. After settling into their containment cell, the Pie Folk disclosed elements of their religious beliefs. They regarded humans as deities and initially panicked upon their first encounters. Profuse apologies and deferential behavior have continued to this day, with the Pie Folk showing reverence to any human who acknowledges them.
