                The Welcoming Period, commonly referred to as TWP, signifies the crucial initiation period when a new Entity is introduced to their dedicated Handler. This period is designed to allow the Entity and Handler to grow accustomed to each other and foster a strong bond. At the heart of TWP are three pivotal tests: Hunger, Stress, and Custom, each serving a specific purpose in this delicate process.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Hunger: Nurturing Resilience</h2>
            <p>
                In the Hunger test, the Entity is provided with only half of their usual meals during this period. This test serves a dual purpose, closely examining how the Entity reacts to a reduced food intake and how the Handler responds to the Entity's needs. The test is carried out in the name of scientific inquiry, with a primary focus on nurturing the resilience of both Entity and Handler. It is noteworthy that no Handlers have suffered harm during the Hunger test.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Stress: The Crucible of Composure</h2>
            <p>
                The Stress test is predominantly designed to evaluate the preparedness and composure of the Handler. It simulates challenging situations, akin to a facility-wide lockdown with alarms blaring. The test offers insights into the Handler's ability to manage stress-inducing scenarios effectively. It is of utmost importance to ensure the Handler can maintain a steadfast approach to their role under stressful conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Custom: Tailored Challenges for Individual Entities</h2>
            <p>
                Freestyle, or Custom, is a test that significantly varies depending on the unique traits and abilities of the Entity in question. This tailored approach allows us to better understand how the Handler adapts to the specific needs and characteristics of their assigned Entity. For instance, in the case of the Shadow King, this test may involve fluctuating and sporadic lighting conditions. Each Custom test is designed with careful consideration of the Entity's unique attributes, aiming to uncover valuable insights.

            <p>
                Despite the inherently challenging nature of TWP, our protocols are diligently structured to minimize potential risks. While accidents have occurred during the Welcoming Period, it is essential to note that there have been no recorded instances of severe injuries or fatalities. The paramount goal of TWP is to build a strong foundation for a productive and harmonious partnership between the Entity and their Handler, with safety and mutual understanding as our guiding principles.
