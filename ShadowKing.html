                <strong>Name:</strong> The Shadow King<br>
                <strong>Nicknames:</strong> Asshole, Shadow Creep, Weirdo, touchy-feely dude, That Pervert<br>
                <strong>Types:</strong> Monstrosity, Bipedal?, Shadow Creature, Humanoid?<br>
                <strong>Level:</strong> 10<br>
                <strong>Diet:</strong> Omnivore<br>
                <strong>Preferred Food:</strong> Tea and Biscuits<br>
                <strong>Handler:</strong> Elizabeth Smith<br>
                <strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Shadow King is to be transported within a specially designed dimly lit container, surrounded by intense, blinding illumination to prevent him from melding into the shadows and escaping. His living quarters should be perpetually shrouded in darkness, with the exception of the Handler's section, which must be bathed in constant light to thwart any attempts at intrusion.<br>
                <strong>Languages:</strong> English
            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>He may be a level 10, but he is about equal in strength to Huggy. Whenever they fight, the results are uniform; Huggy wins some, Shadow King wins some, and they tie.</li>
                <li>The true nature of The Shadow King's form concealed beneath his enigmatic cloak remains a mystery, though it is presumed that he possesses a humanoid appearance, given his upright posture and comportment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong> The Shadow King maintains a dignified and refined demeanor, evoking the mannerisms of a British aristocrat from the 19th century. He addresses female employees with utmost courtesy, using "Lady [Name]," while he employs "Sir [Name]" for their male counterparts. Profanity or impoliteness is met with disdain.</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> An amalgamation of obsidian shadows and frigid, inky tendrils, The Shadow King presents an unsettling visage. He is often adorned with a miniature black top hat and cloak, with strikingly luminous white eyes, accentuating a chilling smile. The remainder of his figure effortlessly melds into the surrounding shadows.</p>
            <p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>For those designated as his Handler, it is imperative never to extinguish the light within the vicinity of their sleeping quarters, as it could result in adverse consequences.</li>
                <li>During power outages, it is of paramount importance to reach the designated safety zones promptly. So long as there is adequate illumination within these areas, The Shadow King remains unable to infiltrate.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Shadow King possesses the extraordinary capacity to manipulate and meld into shadows at will, seamlessly altering their shape and form. His capabilities wane in bright light but conversely enhance his powers in darkness.</li>
                <li>The entity can traverse freely as long as a shadow remains connected to his location, offering him the capacity to move unimpeded through a network of shadows, occasionally necessitating enhanced security measures.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Room:</strong> A Dusk, maximum security level 10 room.</p>
            <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> He is allowed to go outside in the late afternoon once a month, and anything he finds will have to be inspected thoroughly before he can bring it into his room.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>History/Info:</strong> Terrorizing the streets of London since 1890, it took 10 years to capture him, as he is far more intelligent than the normal human. We were finally able to trick him into entering a containment cell after a young woman off the streets volunteered to lure him in. She seemed unusually eager to help, which was later revealed that she is a fan of him, as the Shadow King has quite the rapport in London. He has never caused harm to innocents and has saved countless women from traumatizing events and death. Even though he is quite the chivalrous one, very much a gentleman, he makes it apparent when he wants what he wants.
