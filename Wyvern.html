                <strong>History/Info:</strong> She was discovered in the Himalayan Alps, where she was revered as a deity by the local population, who offered sacrifices to appease her. While her fondness for reindeer as a source of sustenance is evident, much of her history remains shrouded in mystery. Tales recount her saving slaves, facilitating their escape from their masters. This history aligns with the presence of a population in the region who share South American heritage. The villagers have passed down stories of the great Wyvern rescuing their ancestors from enslavement, liberating them from their shackles and leading them to the village.
