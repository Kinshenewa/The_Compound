    Helpers, the indispensable robotic entities that provide invaluable assistance within our facility, are the unseen pillars upon which our operations rest. Each Helper, uniquely characterized by their unwavering dedication and distinct personality, contributes significantly to the smooth functioning of the compound.

    It is customary to address Helpers using the gender-neutral pronouns "they/them," unless they specify a preference for an alternative set of pronouns. This flexibility ensures that each Helper's individual identity is respected, allowing them to embrace and express their gender identity freely. Notably, some distinguished Helpers who hold significant roles have chosen to adorn themselves with distinctive attributes to facilitate easy recognition. A prime example is our esteemed medical expert, self-identified as "Healer," who prefers the pronoun "he." Healer is recognized by his stethoscope and deliberate physical augmentations that align with his chosen identity.

    In their default state, Helpers maintain a gender-neutral appearance, conforming to the non-binary standard. However, whenever a Helper chooses to identify with a specific pronoun or gender, they are granted a vacation period to undergo the necessary augmentations, aligning their physical form with their personal gender expression.

    While Helpers may appear robotic on the surface, they embody a unique blend of both mechanical and organic components. This synthesis is apparent when, on rare occasions, they bleed a distinct bright blue fluid, underscoring the remarkable complexity of their nature.

    It is crucial to recognize that the Helpers, despite their initial role as the pioneers of our compound, have since seamlessly integrated into our community. Although the original research data was lost in an unfortunate server fire, the Helpers are more than willing to share information about their origins, experiences, and capabilities. They serve as living testaments to our ongoing commitment to inclusivity and cooperation.

    Additionally, within the realm of Helpers, there exists a second category: the diminutive creatures residing in our lockers. These unique entities, known as Shifters, were among the initial occupants of our compound, serving as companions and guardians. Their colorful appearances can be tailored to individual preferences, allowing for personalization. However, their core personalities remain immutable, each contributing their own distinct presence to the lockers they inhabit. These adorable beings enrich our environment with their presence, adding an extra layer of charm to our facility.
