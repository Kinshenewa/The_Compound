<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<tag>
<ul>
    What is the Compound, and what is its purpose?
    <li>The Compound is a research facility founded in 1960, initially just a way to legally protect the Helpers that were discovered in a disco club. Over time, the Compound had accrued help, and in 1998, the Compound was officially built, a large crawling expanse of land solely owned by Jonas Bugsworth, a rich man who came from a family of many rich people who passed quite the amount of riches when one passed. The Compound was founded to protect paranormal entities, to research beings that couldn't be explained with simple science.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    How do Entities end up in the Compound?
    <li>Entities are identified and located through a comprehensive process. Our team of Helpers diligently monitors the internet for signs of paranormal activity and deploys agents worldwide to investigate unusual occurrences. When an Entity is detected, we gather information without direct confrontation and employ specially designed, transportable containment cells made of titanium. These cells are strategically placed to lure and safely capture the Entity. In cases like Huggy Wuggy, where immediate medical attention is required, we prioritize the well-being of the Entity during the capture process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    How are Entities classified and assigned levels?
    <li>There are multiple classifications. Each Entity is assigned Types and a Level. Types are more describing of what they are, such as Serpentes meaning they are snake-like in appearance, or Armor, where an Entity is naturally armored. Levels are how dangerous it is to be near an Entity, with 1 being harmless and 10 being extremely dangerous. The Level isn't dependent on solely the power level of an Entity, behavior has a major role in their assigned Level as well. For example, both the Yellow Chick and Pastel Bunny are initially Level 2, but due to the Yellow Chick's good behavior and the Pastel Bunny's aggressive speech, the Yellow Chick was assigned a Level 1 Entity while the Pastel Bunny is a Level 3 Entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    What safety measures are in place to prevent escapes or breaches?
    <li>Each Entity is housed in a specially designed containment room with secure features to prevent escapes. Additionally, we prioritize the well-being of our Entities, ensuring they are content in their rooms, minimizing the incentive for rebellion. In the event of a containment breach, trained Helpers approach the Entity to encourage their return to their room peacefully. If this approach fails, the next step is the administration of tranquilizers to safely subdue the Entity. When an escape occurs, alarms activate throughout the facility, signaling human workers to take refuge in designated safe rooms until the situation is resolved. This protocol significantly reduces the risk of casualties.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    Can I visit the Compound or tour its facilities?
    <li>Yes, you are welcome to visit the Compound and explore our facilities. We offer guided tours every Saturday and Sunday morning at 11 AM. During the tour, visitors will have the opportunity to view some of the safer Entity containment rooms and may even interact with select Entities. The Yellow Chick and Pastel Bunny are known to accompany visitors during these tours, and other Entities can communicate with visitors from their containment cells.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    Are there any risks associated with working at or visiting the Compound?
    <li>There are always risks here, especially if you are a worker. When someone works here, they are constantly surrounded by danger, as while the Entities are all securely locked up, they can always find a way to somehow get out of their containment cells. Entering an Entity's containment cell is always a risky endevour, especially for the more dangerous Entities who attack first, ask questions later. Visiting the Compound can also hold its risks, as at any time an Entity can escape containment and pose serious risks to visitors. Before entering the Compound, we always have visitors sign waivers stating they hold full responsibility of anything that may happen to them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    How are ethical concerns addressed when dealing with Entities?
    <li>
    At the Compound, we prioritize ethical considerations in all aspects of our work with Entities. Ethical concerns are addressed through a combination of guidelines, policies, and ongoing oversight to ensure the well-being and ethical treatment of all Entities. Some key ethical principles that guide our practices include:
<ol>
    <li>Informed Consent: Entities are never coerced into participation. They must provide their consent to any tests, studies, or procedures they are involved in, to the best of their abilities.</li>
    <li>Non-Harm Principle: We prioritize the safety and non-harm of Entities in all interactions. Handlers are trained extensively to ensure the well-being of the Entities under their care.</li>
    <li>Transparency: We maintain transparency in all our interactions with Entities, Handlers, and personnel. Clear communication, both within the Compound and with external parties, is essential.</li>
    <li>Privacy and Dignity: We respect the privacy and dignity of all Entities. Their personal information and experiences are handled with the utmost care, and we ensure that their living conditions are comfortable and respectful.</li>
    <li>Continual Monitoring and Research: We continuously assess and monitor our methods, seeking to minimize any potential negative impacts on Entities. Research efforts are conducted to further understand and improve their quality of life.</li>
    <li>Consent of Handlers: Handlers, who work closely with the Entities, also provide informed consent and undergo rigorous training to ensure that they treat the Entities ethically.</li>
</ol>
We are committed to addressing ethical concerns with the utmost seriousness and taking appropriate measures when necessary to maintain the ethical treatment of Entities. The safety and welfare of Entities are our top priorities, and we continuously strive to improve our ethical practices.

    Are there opportunities for researchers or volunteers to get involved with the Compound?
    <li>We welcome individuals with a keen interest in unraveling the mysteries of the paranormal beings that inhabit our world. The Compound offers internship programs periodically throughout the year, providing opportunities for teenagers to gain practical experience during the summer while also earning valuable college application points. Interested candidates are encouraged to apply for our internship program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    What do I do if I encounter an Entity outside of the Compound?
    <li>If you ever come across an unfamiliar and potentially anomalous being while outside the Compound, we strongly advise you to prioritize your safety. The best course of action is to swiftly vacate the area and immediately contact the Compound. However, we must emphasize that you should not intervene or approach the Entity, except in cases where the Entity appears to be experiencing mistreatment or harm to its physical and mental well-being. In such cases, you can take appropriate measures to protect the Entity and contact the Compound for guidance and assistance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    Can I adopt or own an Entity from the Compound?
    <li>Unfortunately, we cannot allow such a thing in most cases, as most of our Entites housed here are strictly forbidden from being let loose in the world, though there are exceptions. This Database is the information free to the public, so there is many more Entities contained here than you would be led to believe. Currently we are slowly declassifying files and deciding which will go onto this website and which will stay strictly for employee eyes only, Currently, the only Entities you can adopt or own would be nagas, as there are quite a number of nagas with partners.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
