                <strong>History/Info:</strong> The initial discovery of Pie Folk took place on a remote Galapagos island. The initial interaction between researchers and the Pie Folk was marked by initial hostility, with the diminutive inhabitants wielding miniature spears and launching them as javelins. After a period of negotiation, the Pie Folk agreed to accompany the researchers. Following their settlement in the containment cell, the Pie Folk shared elements of their religious beliefs, expressing their view of humans as deities. Their initial panic subsided, leading to profuse apologies and ongoing deferential behavior, including bowing to any human who acknowledges them.
